# Attractor

A bullet hell game where the player can't shoot. Made in one weekend for an Unreal Game Jam. We were inspired by the idea of bad super powers such as 'the ability to suddenly make your hands sticky' and thought it would be funny if a character magnetically attracted bullets. This sparked the idea for a bullet hell game where, instead of shooting your enemies, you must fling their bullets back at them by moving strategically.
